                        <h2>WE ARE NAIL TECH</h2>
                        <p>We’re immigrants living in the U.S., and we chose the nail industry as the starting point for our career journey. Over the past three years, we’ve had so many amazing experiences—meeting new people, learning new skills, and growing along the way. All these moments have given us fresh perspectives and reshaped how we see the world around us.</p>

                <h2>WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS NAIL INDUSTRY</h2>
                <p>As nail techs, we’ve seen it all—clients with wild requests, co-workers with quirks, owners with “creative” ideas, managers with interesting priorities, and of course, our own moments of chaos. Some experiences are unique, but many are universal to anyone in this field. Trust us, we’ve got stories!</p>
                <p>As newcomers to the U.S., we started out with a ton of questions—some of them hilariously clueless. Ever wondered why some clients happily drop $100 (or more) on a manicure or pedicure? Or why so many Vietnamese folks thrive in the nail industry? Or how to find the perfect salon to pamper you? At Nailspiel, we love diving into those questions and sharing insights from the service provider’s side of the story.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to share and discuss about the nail industry—whether you’re a fellow nail tech or someone who’s just curious about the world behind the polish. Welcome to Nailspiel, where we bring you the good, and the downright surprising side of nails!</p>
